        "**`AutoGen`** is a versatile framework that facilitates the creation of LLM applications by employing multiple agents capable of interacting with one another to tackle tasks. These AutoGen agents can be tailored to specific needs, engage in conversations, and seamlessly integrate human participation. They are adaptable to different operation modes that encompass the utilization of LLMs, human inputs, and various tools.\n",

These embedded chunks are stored in a FAISS vector database. At query time, the k-most similar chunks to a given query are retrieved from the database. The original query and retrieved chunks are compiled into a prompt and passed to the Language Model for generating the answer. The workflow also includes a summarization process where representative chunks are selected, keywords are generated, and a final abstractive summary is created.\n",
